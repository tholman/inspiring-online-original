_[Tumblr's humans.txt](http://tumblr.com/humans.txt) file, turns out to be an awesome text adventure. What a great little easter egg._

Traditionally, websites include a robots.txt file, in their site root, which tells crawlers and bots (like Google) how to behave.

A few sites have been adding humans.txt files to give info about who has created and maintains the site... that said, I think Tumblr's easter egg is a step above!
