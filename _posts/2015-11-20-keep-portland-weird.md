_[Keep Portland Weird](http://keepearthquakesweird.com/) is the kind of project that keeps the strange alive, on the internet._

After learning about the possibility of an impending earthquake, the agency [Oblio](http://oblio.io/) set to work on the beautifully uninformative project [Keep Portland Weird](http://keepearthquakesweird.com/).

Earthquake preparedness the Portland way sounds like the right way to me.
