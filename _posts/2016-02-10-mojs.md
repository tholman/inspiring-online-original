_[mo • js](http://mojs.io) is a JavaScript animation toolkit for the web._

It aims at making animations in the internet more easy to create with a fast, Retina ready, simple, modular and robust API. There's currently just one tutorial about path easing, but you should definitely check it out.

By the way, it's open source: [mo • js on GitHub](https://github.com/legomushroom/mojs).
